# Photo-Gellary-Website
# Website Information
- I have developed a visually appealing website for a professional photo gallery using the latest web technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and PHP. The website's database is powered by MySQL, and the entire website is hosted on infinityfreeapp.com, ensuring reliable performance and availability.

This website serves as an online platform that showcases the work of a talented photographer. It features comprehensive details about the photographer, including their name, a captivating photo portfolio, and information about each photo, such as its title, description, and the device used to capture it. Additionally, the website displays the upload date of each photo, providing visitors with up-to-date information.
